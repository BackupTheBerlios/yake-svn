		<title>Building Yake</title>
		<para>At the moment we do not provide prebuilt libraries for Yake. Also note that this chapter is just a quick introduction. We expect the developer
		attempting to use Yake to know how to use the build tools of his choice (e.g. the VC7.1 IDE with its build options on the Win32 platform).

			<title>Windows (using VC7.1)</title>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>Extract the sources into a folder of your choice, let's call it YAKEHOME.</listitem>
				<listitem>Extract the dependencies package into YAKEHOME. Verify correct extraction (mainly that files are in the correct folders)!</listitem>
				<listitem>Open the solution file YAKEHOME/scripts/yake.sln in the VC7.1 IDE.</listitem>
				<listitem>Right-click on the solution in the solution explorer and choose "Build All" or "Batch build".</listitem>
				<listitem>If the build process was successful you will find the import libraries located in YAKEHOME/common/lib/[debug|release], the dynamic link libraries as well as the sample executables in YAKEHOME/common/bin/[debug|release].</listitem>

			<title>Other platforms (Linux, MacOS X)</title>
			<para>Officially supported build environments for Linux will be available soon.

			<para>As no member of the Yake team has access to MacOS X we cannot provide ready-to-use build tools for the time being.
			Contributions are welcome.
